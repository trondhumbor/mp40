## Call of Duty: Black Ops - MP40 modification

![MP40 in-game screenshot](/screenshots/shot0000.jpg?raw=true "")

This mod adds the MP40 to CoD:BO's multiplayer. The gun is actually included in the game files, but was never officially added to the multiplayer. This mod allows the gun to be used in MP, and it will automatically be given to the player on spawn. Please note that some sounds (reloads etc.) aren't included in the game, and will thus not be played.

### Installation:
* Put the the files in the `/mods` folder.
* Launch the Black Ops modtools, check `Link FastFile` and `Build IWD`, then hit `Build mod`.
